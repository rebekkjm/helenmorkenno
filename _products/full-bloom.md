A hundred porcelain petals form a glowing bud and the shadow of an open flower on the ceiling above.

I make *Full Bloom* to order to be the focal point of your room. This lamp also works well in a group filling a much bigger interior space.

*Example dimensions: 60 cm diameter, 80 cm height*

*Price approx. NOK 12000 â€“ 15000 dependent on size*
