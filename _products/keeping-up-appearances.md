A glittering chandelier usually tells a story of status and prosperity. Where you would expect to find elegant crystal a closer look reveals broken jars and bottles â€“ shattered remnants of unadorned everyday life.

Made to order, I make this piece to suit your space. Example dimensions: approximately 60 cm x 80 cm.
