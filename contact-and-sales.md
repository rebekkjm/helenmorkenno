Decorative lighting can transform a space. I love to create for specific rooms, so please don’t hesitate to contact me if you have an idea or would like to commission something special.

<h3>About my work</h3>
I work primarily with thin porcelain, often combined with light. Much of my work contains contrasts and layers of meaning and I often incorporate hidden details or unexpected elements in my work so there is more to discover than first meets the eye.

Porcelain is a demanding material to work with, but the resulting whiteness, translucency and strength (despite its fragile appearance) are worth the challenge. I usually prefer a matt unglazed surface, but since the clay is fully vitrified and non-porous, every piece is totally washable. All pieces are completely handmade and can be adjusted to meet specific requests. My work fits easily into a wide range of interiors, adding a focus of interest to any space.
