I work primarily with thin porcelain, often combined with light. My strongest influence is the natural environment, both in Norway, where I live, and in Britain where I grew up and studied. Discovering the essence of the world around me is at the core of my work, and I believe that if I can convey something of this, it will trigger a sense of well-being and resonance in others. Much of my work contains contrasts and layers of meaning – a beautiful sculptural object in daylight transformed when illuminated from within, white translucent porcelain offset by heavy black stoneware. I often incorporate hidden details or unexpected elements in my work so there is more to discover than first meets the eye. 

Porcelain is a demanding material to work with, but the resulting whiteness, translucency and strength (despite its fragile appearance) are worth the challenge. I usually prefer a matt unglazed surface, but since the clay is fully vitrified and non-porous, every piece is totally washable. All pieces are completely handmade and can be adjusted to specific requests. My work fits easily into a wide range of interiors, adding a focus of interest to any space.
I use only CE-approved light fittings and flexes.
